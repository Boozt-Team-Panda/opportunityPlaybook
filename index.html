                        We're moving from a <strong>feature-led, stakeholder-driven model</strong> to an
                        <strong>outcome-driven, opportunity-led model</strong>. This playbook aligns our teams
                        around solving <strong>real user problems</strong> with strategic impact ‚Äî not shipping

                    <p>
                        The "Parking Lot ‚Üí Delivery" model is broken because it often leads to a backlog of
                        unvalidated ideas, built without a clear understanding of customer needs or business
                        outcomes. This results in wasted effort, slower time-to-value, and a lack of strategic
                        alignment. This playbook is a crucial step in Boozt‚Äôs ambition to mature product
                        practices by empowering teams to focus on customer-centric outcomes.

                            <strong>Start with problems, not solutions:</strong> Our primary focus is
                            understanding and defining the user or business problem before jumping to any specific
                            solution.

                            <strong>Discovery is continuous, not a phase:</strong> Product discovery is an ongoing
                            activity, not a one-off project phase. We continuously learn, test, and iterate.

                            <strong>Empower teams to own the how:</strong> Teams are best positioned to determine

                            <strong>Measure success by outcomes, not outputs:</strong> We define and track success
                            based on measurable impacts (outcomes) rather than just features shipped (outputs).

                        The <strong>Opportunity Backlog</strong> is a prioritized, transparent list of
                        well-defined user or business problems that, if solved, would contribute significantly
                        to our strategic goals. It is fundamentally different from a traditional "Parking Lot"
                        which often collects unrefined ideas or feature requests.

                    <p>
                        <strong>What qualifies as an Opportunity?</strong> An Opportunity is a clearly
                        articulated problem statement, validated by evidence, with a clear link to our strategic
                        objectives. It focuses on <em>what</em> problem to solve, not <em>how</em> to solve it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>How is it different from the Parking Lot?</strong> The Parking Lot is often a
                        dumping ground for ideas. The Opportunity Backlog is curated, evidence-backed,
                        strategically aligned, and actively managed. Entries are refined, researched, and
                        regularly reviewed.

                    <p>
                        <strong>How do we keep it prioritized and visible?</strong> The Head of Product
                        Management, in collaboration with Product Managers and Product Leadership, owns the
                        prioritization and visibility of the Opportunity Backlog. It should be maintained in a
                        shared tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Productboard) and regularly reviewed during
                        Opportunity Review sessions.

                    <p>
                        Teams are empowered to <strong>pull opportunities</strong> from the Opportunity Backlog
                        into their continuous discovery process. This ensures ownership, motivation, and a deep
                        understanding of the problem space. Teams should choose opportunities that align with
                        their specific domain and expertise, and that they believe they can realistically
                        impact.

                    <p>
                        <strong>How do teams choose opportunities?</strong> Product Managers, in collaboration
                        with their design and engineering counterparts, review the prioritized Opportunity
                        Backlog. They select the next opportunity that best fits their team's capacity,
                        expertise, and strategic alignment, ensuring they have sufficient evidence to begin
                        discovery.

                    <p>
                        <strong>What‚Äôs the lightweight Discovery template?</strong> The Discovery template
                        provides a structured approach to exploring an opportunity without being overly
                        prescriptive. It focuses on documenting learning and validating assumptions.

                        <strong>How do we avoid stage gates?</strong> Discovery is continuous. Instead of formal
                        stage gates, we encourage frequent, lightweight sharing of insights within the team and
                        with relevant stakeholders. The "Decision" field in the Discovery Log acts as a
                        checkpoint, driving towards clarity on the next steps rather than a formal hand-off.

                                    <strong>Response:</strong> This suggests a potential issue with understanding the
                                    process, team motivation, or clarity of the Opportunity Backlog. Leadership should
                                    engage the team to understand the root cause, provide coaching, or refine
                                    opportunities. It might also indicate a need for more strategic guidance or

                                    <strong>Response:</strong> While rare, this signifies strong learning! It means
                                    the hypotheses were incorrect, or the problems weren't as impactful as initially
                                    thought. This feedback is invaluable. Leaders should commend the team for their
                                    rigorous discovery and use these learnings to inform new strategic inputs or pivot
                                    to different opportunities. It avoids building the wrong thing.

                                    <strong>Response:</strong> This is where the playbook's principles are crucial.
                                    Politically redirect the stakeholder to the Opportunity Backlog and the
                                    problem-first approach. Ask them: "What problem is this feature solving, and what
                                    evidence supports its importance?" Offer to help them articulate the problem as an
                                    opportunity, which can then be prioritized and enter the discovery flow. Emphasize
                                    that we ship outcomes, not just features.
